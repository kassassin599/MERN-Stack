/* **CSS - Cascading Style Sheets** */

/* **What is CSS?** */
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to describe how HTML elements should appear on screens, paper, or other media.

A CSS rule is written with a "declaration block," which contains one or more style declarations. Each declaration consists of a CSS property name and its value, separated by a colon. 
You can write multiple declarations, separating each with a semicolon, 
and the whole block is enclosed in curly braces.



/* **CSS Selectors** */

CSS selectors are used to select HTML elements that you want to style. 


/*There are five main types of CSS selectors:*/
/*1. **Simple selectors** - They select elements based on the element's name, ID, or class.*/
/*2. **Combinator selectors** - They select elements based on the relationship between elements.*/
/*3. **Pseudo-class selectors** - These select elements based on a certain state (e.g., :hover).*/
/*4. **Pseudo-elements selectors** - These select and style a specific part of an element (e.g., ::before).*/
/*5. **Attribute selectors** - They select elements based on attributes or attribute values.*/



/* **The Element Selector** */

The element selector selects HTML elements by their tag name.

*Example:* To center and make all `<p>` elements red:
css
p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}




/* **The ID Selector** */

The ID selector selects a unique element by its `id` attribute. Since `id` is unique within a page, it targets only one element.

*Example:* To style an element with the `id="para1"`:
css
#para1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

html
<p id="para1">Hello World!</p>




/* **The Class Selector** */

The class selector is used to style elements with a specific class. Unlike IDs, multiple elements can share the same class.

*Example:* To style all elements with the class `"center"`:
css
.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

html
<h1 class="center">Red and centered</h1>
<p class="center">This text is red and centered.</p>


You can also specify class styles for specific elements:
css
p.center {
    color: red;
}


*HTML elements can have more than one class:*
css
p.large {
    font-size: 300%;
}

html
<p class="center large">This paragraph is red, centered, and large.</p>




/* **The Universal Selector** */

The universal selector (`*`) applies styles to all elements on the page.

*Example:*
css
* {
    text-align: center;
    color: blue;
}




/* **The Grouping Selector** */

Grouping selectors allow you to apply the same style to multiple elements at once, minimizing code repetition.

*Example:* Instead of writing separate rules for `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>`, you can group them:
css
h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}




/* **Difference Between Class and ID** */

- A class can be used for multiple elements, while an `id` is unique to one element.

*Example:* To style an element with the `id="myHeader"`:
css
#myHeader {
    background-color: lightblue;
    color: black;
    padding: 40px;
    text-align: center;
}


.city {
    background-color: tomato;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
}

html
<h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>
<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
